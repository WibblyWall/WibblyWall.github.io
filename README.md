## About Me
I am a current music composition major with a programming minor with a love for video games. I love being able to mix my musical abilities with my programming to make immersive environments. I enjoy building worlds and stories and telling them through mixed media. I have and am currently working on the soundtrack for the spiritual successor to the old amiga game *Agony* called *Anguish*. I am also working on some other soundtracks which I don't know if I can talk about, and I'm coding and working on a game called *The Year Is 30XX*.

## Resume
